* Breadth First Traversal for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is,
unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than
once, we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting
vertex.

* The implementation of DFS is similar to BFS, the only difference is that queue is replaced by stack.
