When we delete a node, three possibilities arise:

1) Node to be deleted is leaf: Simply remove from the tree.

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(20)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    30     70
         /  \    /  \                     \    /  \
       20   40  60   80                   40  60   80

2) Node to be deleted has only one child: Copy the child to the node and delete the child.

              50                            50
           /     \         delete(30)      /   \
          30      70       --------->    40     70
            \    /  \                          /  \
            40  60   80                       60   80

3) Node to be deleted has two children: Find the minimum of right subtree: it is > left subtree and <= any element in
right subtree, preserving the BST property.

              50                            60
           /     \         delete(50)      /   \
          40      70       --------->    40    70
                 /  \                            \
                60   80                           80
